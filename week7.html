      <p>Even though this was an output devices project, I decided to use a potentiometer as my required input device 
        being that I had never used one before.

    <p>I wired up the potentiometer and began writing a first program

    <p>I made a basic program that would make a trigger whenever the potentiometer was turned more than halfway (500)

    <p>After that I used this github to get a buzzer file for tetris

    <p> Then while playing that buzzerfile triggered from the potentiometer I analised the sound with the ossisiscope

    was far too long to do any tests on, so I setteled on "happy birthday" which a video can be found here</p>

    <p> <a href="pic7/buzzer/buzzer.ino"> Buzzer code</a> If you are interested in the code it can be found here, although heres a portion included</p>

    <pre><code>

void loop() {
  Serial.println(analogRead(POTENTIOMETER_PIN));
  

  if (POTENTIOMETER_PIN > 500) { // button is pressed
    Serial.println("potentiometer is larger than 500");
    buzzer();
  }
}

void buzzer() {
  bclass ob1;
  
  
  // iterate over the notes of the melody:
  int size = sizeof(noteDurations) / sizeof(int);

  for (int thisNote = 0; thisNote < size; thisNote++) {
    // to calculate the note duration, take one second divided by the note type.
    //e.g. quarter note = 1000 / 4, eighth note = 1000/8, etc.
    int noteDuration = 1000 / noteDurations[thisNote];
    tone(BUZZER_PIN, melody[thisNote], noteDuration);

    // to distinguish the notes, set a minimum time between them.
    // the note's duration + 30% seems to work well:
    int pauseBetweenNotes = noteDuration * 1.30;
    delay(pauseBetweenNotes);
    // stop the tone playing:
    noTone(BUZZER_PIN);

  <p> For my CNC file I really wanted to mill out and cast my face, not my whole head because I know the CNC cant do that, just the front part of the face
