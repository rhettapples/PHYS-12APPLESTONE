        <p>This was my idea and circuit diagram, a machine that you could type in any letter in the englis hlanguage
          , and it would blink that letters corrisponding "code" in braille

        <p>I went through a whole hour long troubblechuting process because for some reason I couldnt upload a sketch,
          I thought that I had a deffective board, later to realize that I was messing up becuase I had the "1" pin connected
          which breaks everything for some reason

      <p>here is a demo, and, because my code is multiple hundreads of lines long, I was told to not include code snippets, rather including a download of the sketch</p>

      <code>
        int a = 2;
        int b = 3;
        int c = 4;
        int d = 5;
        int e = 6;
        int f = 7;
        char one;
        void setup() {
          Serial.begin(9600);
          // initialize digital pin LED_BUILTIN as an output.
          pinMode(2, OUTPUT);
          pinMode(3, OUTPUT);
          pinMode(4, OUTPUT);
          pinMode(5, OUTPUT);
          pinMode(6, OUTPUT);
          pinMode(7, OUTPUT);

        }

        // the loop function runs over and over again forever
        void loop() {
            if(Serial.available()){
                one = Serial.read();
                Serial.println(one);

          if (one == 'a'){
            digitalWrite(a, HIGH);
