        <p>IDEA: A kinetic sculpture that consists of a hammer that is moved up and down somehow.
          The hammer would need to be mounted on an axel, and have a cam mounted to a motor that is offset
          to contact the hammer's bottom and move it up.

        <p>First I took measurements of the axel that would be attached to the hammer's bottom</p>

        <p>Then I made an outline of what I wanted with a variable as the axel diameter</p>

        <p>I chamfered the edges of the hammer and then projected it and exported it as a dxf</p>

        <p>I then made cam dimentions that seemed viable, and offset the hole and saved it as a dxc</p>

        <p>I made 5 coppies of the cam and the hammer and sent it to the lazer cutter</p>

        <p>I glued the hammer pieces, and cam pieces, making sure to keep the holes in line</p>

        <p>I tested the motor and started planning out the fitting</p>

        <p>After planning out a design I held the motor manually on the hammer 
          to figure out where I should mount it.

        <p>It worked perfectly first try thankfully.
