        <p>My original Idea for a final project was just a grid display that could be operated through a website, I decided this was 
          a bit too boring,

      <section>
        <p>Instead I opted to make a tetris board! 
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/1.jpg"></center></p>
        <p>I found a video that did something similar to what I wanted to do by electronoobs, but there were some main changes that I wanted to have: Namely a 
          detached controller, no joystick, no music in the backround, and a few other custom modifications.

      <section>
        <p>Next step was to gather the materials, the largest problem being the 128 leds that were needed to fill the 8x16 board
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/2.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>After getting all the LEDS I found a suitable board to mount them and started cutting and sizing the positioning
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/3.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Then I started taping them down after I measured the correct placement
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/4.JPG"></center></p>

        <p><center><img src="f/5.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>This was the final placement of all of them forming the grid, I stuck them down with center rows of tape 
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/6.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>After that it was time to start soldering, I had to connect each ground, power and input of each strip to the one above it which took a lot of time to do accurately.

      <section>
        <p>At this point I also started working on the controller, I wanted a pause, start and Dpad of up, down, left, and right
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/10.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>I switched from the larger board to something that would make more sense for size
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/11.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>I taped all the buttons down and began planning
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/12.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>I decided to have pins coming up that I would solder each of the buttons to (and a ground pin)
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/13.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>The first thing to do was solder all of them to a common ground
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/14.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Then working to solder all of the individual pins for each button, and the common ground
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/15.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>It was at this very moment that I connected the grid and realized something terrible... since the LED strips were very beat up the singals
          were getting messed up and they couldnt display the correct color. This was a major setback, and I had to get LEDS from microcenter. This also meant that the 
          last 4 hours of work was essentially going down the drain.
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/16.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>I got the new strip and it worked perfectly
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/17.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>It was time to say goodbye and rip out all of the strips and put new ones in, but there was another problem.
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/18.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>As you can see here the spacing on the board is a bit over an inch and a half.
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/19.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>And the only leds at microcenter were about spaced less than an inch. At this point I had two options, make a smaller board, or individually solder 762 connections to make it the right size
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/20.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>I choose the ladder after doing a test strip, knowing it would likely take an entire day.
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/21.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>I cut and lined them up and got to work
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/22.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>This process was extremely extremely tedious, had a high chance of failure if even one solder was messed up, and was the source of much backpain (would not recomend)
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/23.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>I frequently tested to make sure no solders were messed up
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/24.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>

      <section>
        <p>It worked! Atleast for the first few rows
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/26.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>This was another test after more rows
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/27.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>And here it was completed in all its glory, It took a full day to get it wired up, I think it was worth it
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/28.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>I put a piece of opaque plastic over it, and let someone give it a test run. Its at this point I should clarify my usage of electronoobs code and library. I took his original file found <a href="http://electronoobs.com/eng_arduino_tut104_code1.php">Here</a> And modified it to take away a lot of the bells and whistles that I didnt like such as the buzzer, joystick, and segmented display, and add a few extra things such as my custom loading screen.
          My code can be found here <a href="f/tetriscode/RhettrisCode/RhettrisCode.ino">Rhett Tetris code</a>

        <p>I cut down the opaque plastic to match the display

      <section>
        <p>Then I mounted the arduino Mega I was using (was told I could use it) to the back with an on/off switch

      <section>
        <p>I decided to make the lights look more squarelike, so I cut down some foamboard, into strips, also cutting some wires to make the controller easier to hold.
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/32.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>I stripped all the wires on the board, and began to solder

        <p><center><img src="f/33.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>This is what it looked like with all the wires soldered

        <p><center><img src="f/34.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>Then It was time to glue all the rows and colums

        <p><center><img src="f/35.JPG"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>I tested it with just the columns to make sure it looked good, then continued with the rows

      </section>
      <section>
        <p>This process also took a fair amount of time, but I thankfully got help

        <p><center><img src="f/40.JPG"></center></p>

      <section>
        <p>I also glued foamboard to the sides to make it look nice

      <section>
        <p>The next thing to do was to design the controller housing which started with measurements of the board, it was drawn up in fusion 360

        <p><center><img src="f/42.png"></center></p>

      </section>

        <p>I ajusted the orientation so it could print well, and exported it

        <p><center><img src="f/46.png"></center></p>
   
      </section>
      <section>
        <p>It was then imported into slic3r and sent to the prusa
        </p>
        <p><center><img src="f/47.png"></center></p>
